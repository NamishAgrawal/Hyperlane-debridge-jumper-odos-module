# Hyperlane-debridge-jumper-odos-module

## Overview
**Hyperlane-debridge-jumper-odos-module** is a module under active development aimed at facilitating blockchain transactions across various chains using multiple bridges (Hyperlane, Debridge, Jumper, Odos). This approach is designed to randomize chain movements, mitigating bot detection risks and enhancing onchain activity footprint.

## Development Status
This project is currently in active development. The plan is to consolidate all modules into a single JavaScript file for streamlined deployment and execution.

## Features
- **Multi-Bridge Integration:** Utilize Hyperlane, Debridge, Jumper, and Odos for chain-to-chain transactions and activity.
- **Randomized Chain Switching:** Enhance security and avoid bot detection with randomized chain movements and random swaps and.
- **Onchain Footprint Optimization:** Maximize onchain activity to increase engagement and network presence.

## Roadmap (Future Plans)
- Consolidate modules into a single JavaScript file. 
- Implement comprehensive documentation and usage guides.
- Conduct testing and optimization for performance and security.

## Usage (To be Updated)
Instructions for using the module will be provided once development reaches a stable release.
